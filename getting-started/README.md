## Let's first get some things straight

<summary>Vlearned is an organizational-based LMS</summary>

At the core, Vlearned was tailored with the goal of satisfying most organizational needs. We did this by adopting an <mark style="color:blue;">**organization-first architecture**</mark> throughout the entire lifecycle of the LMS. We don't claim that this strategy is perfect, but we believe that it will help us build the best LMS for you.
