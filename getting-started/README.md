## Let's first get some things straight

<details>

<summary>Vlearned is an organizational-based LMS</summary>

At the core, Vlearned was tailored with the goal of satisfying most organizational needs. We did this by adopting an **organization-first architecture** throughout the entire lifecycle of the LMS. We don't claim that this strategy is perfect, but we believe that it will help us build the best LMS for you.

<summary>It is not for everyone, but caters for most</summary>

We built Vlearned for **Schools**, **Corporate Organizations**, **Private Tutors**, and **NGOs** that are looking to improve their online learning capabilities and provide a more personalized learning experience for their students or employees.
