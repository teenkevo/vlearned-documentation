## Create your organization and user profile

After signing in, you'll see the page below prompting you to create your **organization** and **profile**.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Vlearned Tip: It doesn't matter if you don't have an organization in real life**. Using Vlearned, you can create one for yourself using the form fields provided. The "_Create profile_" option will only be available once your organization has been created.
{% endhint %}

### Create your organization

### Create your profile

Once your organization has been created, the "Create organization" option will be checked and the "Create profile" option will become clickable opening the profile creator dialog.

{% hint style="info" %}
Here you are creating an **Administrator Profile** for yourself because the organization you created previously is required to have at least one admin (yourself in this case). With this profile, you will be able to onboard other users (admins, instructors, and trainees) into your organization.
{% endhint %}
