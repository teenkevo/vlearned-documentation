## Create your organization and user profile

After signing in, you'll see the page below prompting you to create your **organization** and **profile**.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Vlearned Tip: It doesn't matter if you don't have an organization in real life**. Vlearned allows you to create and manage one for yourself.
{% endhint %}

### Create your profile

Once your organization has been created, the "Create organization" option will become checked âœ… and the "Create profile" option will become clickable allowing you to create your profile

{% hint style="info" %}
**Vlearned Tip:** Here you are creating an **Administrator Profile** for yourself because the organization you created is required to have at least one admin (yourself in this case).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

With this profile, you will be able to onboard other users (admins, instructors, and trainees) into your organization.
