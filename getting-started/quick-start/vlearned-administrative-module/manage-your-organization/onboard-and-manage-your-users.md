# Onboard and Manage your Users

## Role Overview

After you log into your organization's account, it is up to you as an administrator to import users into the system and assign them roles. An email address can only be assigned to one role in an organization. If you wish to assign one person with multiple roles you can use an alternate email address and assign a different role. An account can be associated with any of the roles shown below:

## Assigning a user role in your organization

When you access your organization you will see an overview of the roles available for your organization and how many slots you have left. The number of slots available is dependent on your subscription plan. User import can be done in two ways; individually or in batches. Once you have imported a user into a role, they will receive an account verification email from Vlearned. Prior to email verification all assigned users will appear under your pending assignments.



### Assigning an Individual Role

User importation is easily done using the profile creator forms for Administrators, Instructors and Trainees.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Vlearned will automatically generate a default password for the user profile. No need to remember this, the user will receive a password reset ticket automatically.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
When creating an instructor's profile, you can assign them internal or external status prior to adding them to your organization. External instructors have limited permissions for organizational access.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Assigning a role to a batch of users

Alternatively, if pressed for time you can add users to your organization via a bulk upload. This essentially entails your input of user details into a CSV file and uploading it to Vlearned.

{% hint style="info" %}
An instruction manual is attached which includes a file template you can use to add user information and upload at a go.
{% endhint %}

## Managing your users

Yay!!! You have now successfully managed to add all your administrators, instructors and your trainees have been successfully enrolled. This is the awesome part, or rather the other awesome part. You now get to see how you can maneuver your assigned user roles in the Vlearned system.&#x20;

### User Profile Access

After you import your users to a particular role the Vlearned system creates a user profile for them. Simply click on their email address under the role and you will be led to their user profile where you can access their user diagnostics and the role manager.

### User Diagnostics

This section of the user profile provides you with the user's overall usage information; date joined on, last login, last IP address used and total number of logins.

### Role Manager

The role manager is in equal parts useful and dangerous. You can change a user's role in this section but doing so will result in loss of access to their previous role and all actions taken in it. The role manager displays the current role of the user and gives you options for the new role you would like to assign. To switch a users' role select a new role and click on the assign role tab.

### Danger Zone

This section enables you to delete users from the system.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Be careful of any actions taken here as they might be not only detrimental but irreversible.
{% endhint %}
