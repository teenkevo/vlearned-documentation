## Role Overview

After you log into your organization's account, it is up to you as an administrator to import users into the system and assign them roles. An email address can only be assigned to one role in an organization. If you wish to assign one person with multiple roles you can use an alternate email address and assign a different role. An account can be associated with any of the roles shown below:

### Assigning a user role in your organization

When you access your organization you will see an overview of the roles available for your organization and how many slots you have left. The number of slots available is dependent on your subscription plan.&#x20;
