{% hint style="info" %}
If your training method or training type isn't on the suggestions, you can add your own then select it from the drop-down list.

#### Scheduler

The scheduler set-up is entirely dependent on whether your module is a once-off event or a recurring one.

Subjects with their visibility off will not show in the trainee app but you have access to them.
