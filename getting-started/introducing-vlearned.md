## Vlearned is built to carry your load

Many organizations are tired of using **clunky** and **outdated** Learning Management Systems that fail to engage learners and make instructors' jobs more difficult. Our state-of-the-art LMS is designed to revolutionize the way you teach and learn. With interactive features, an easy-to-use interface, and tracking tools, our system is built to enhance student engagement and boost knowledge retention. Unlike other LMSs that are difficult to navigate and lack the tools you need to effectively manage your classes, our system is user-friendly and packed with everything you need to take your education to the next level. **There's no reason to settle for a subpar learning experience**.

Learners crave **convenience** and **adaptability** in an LMS, allowing them to learn smartly at their own pace and on their own terms.

## Vlearned's Role-Based Acess Control

With Vlearned's RBAC, we hoped to decrease the need for paperwork and password changes when our customer organizations onboard new users or manage existing ones. RBAC lets organizations quickly add and change roles as well as customize each user's experience.&#x20;
