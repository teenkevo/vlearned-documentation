## How to calculate your fees when upgrading or downgrading <a href="#article-header-title" id="article-header-title"></a>

Vlearned lets you upgrade or downgrade your current subscription plan at any point during your monthly billing cycle. While doing this, Vlearned applies prorated billing to charge fairly, based on actual usage.

#### **Let’s see how the Vlearned Proration system works**

When you subscribe to a Vlearned subscription paid plan, you’re always charged at the beginning of your billing cycle (i.e., the day you purchased your initial plan) for a full month’s use (i.e., until the end of your billing cycle), regardless of the day you upgrade or downgrade.

When you change subscription plans in the middle of your billing cycle, then your usage for the remaining days until you’re charged again is different than what you have paid for at the beginning of the billing cycle. So, depending on whether you’re upgrading or downgrading, you would either have to:

* pay an additional amount or
* get a reimbursement.

That’s where prorated (i.e., proportionate) billing comes in to save the day. The Vlearned billing system calculates the difference between what you have already paid (i.e., at the beginning of your billing cycle) and what you should have paid (i.e., based on your usage from the beginning of your billing cycle until the day you’ve changed plans). Then, the difference is added to (or subtracted from) your next bill. That’s why the charges on a new plan are:

* Higher than the standard fee when you upgrade.
* Lower than the standard fee when you downgrade.

Of course, all the adjustments are included in your invoice as separate items so that you know exactly what you’re charged for.

#### Here is a quick sample invoice

When you sign up for the SME Tier-1 12-months plan (i.e., $951/year for up to 25 registered users) on the 5th of February 2023 in the morning, you’re charged $951 on the 5th of February same time in the morning each year. If during the 1st month, you upgrade to SME Tier-1 monthly plan (i.e., $99/month for up to 25 registered users) on the 5th of February 2023, you'd be charged for the first few hours of month 1 (**$0.05**) and the remaining unused time on the subscription plan (**$950.95**) kept for re-use on your new plan of <mark style="color:blue;">****</mark>** $99.** This means that for your new plan, you would pay **$99** from the remaining **$950.95** and still have a balance of **$851.95.**

#### **Cancellation**

When you cancel your subscription at any point during your monthly billing cycle, your Vlearned portal remains active until the end of the billing cycle before downgrading to the free subscription plan. If anything is preventing the downgrade, you will need to first attend to the issue before you or your onboarded users can access your account.
