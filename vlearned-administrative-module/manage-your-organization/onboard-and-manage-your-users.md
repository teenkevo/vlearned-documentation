# Onboard and Manage your Users

## Role Overview

As an administrator, it is up to you to import users into the system and assign them roles.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Vlearned Tip:** An email address can only be assigned to one role in an organization. If you wish to assign one person multiple roles, you can use an alternate email address and assign a different one.
{% endhint %}

An account can be associated with any of the roles shown below

## Assigning a user role in your organization

When you access your organization you will see an overview of the roles available for your organization.

You can click on any of the roles to start onboarding users in that role.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Vlearned Tip:** The onboarding process is the same for all the roles. For a guiding example, we shall go through the **Admin onboarding process** below.
{% endhint %}

Adding administrators can be done in two ways; **individually** or in **batches**.&#x20;

### Assigning an Individual Role

To assign an administrator one by one, click **Add an Admin **<mark style="color:blue;">****</mark> and onboard an administrator using the form details provided.

#### Administrator basic information

{% hint style="info" %}
**Vlearned Tip**: A default password will be generated for the user. No need to remember this, the user will receive a password reset ticket automatically.
{% endhint %}

#### Administrator Address Information

#### Organization Designation Information

### Assigning a role to a batch of users

Alternatively, we understand that many organizations already have their existing user bases and there is usually a need to migrate these users to a system like Vlearned. We provide a straightforward **bulk import** onboarding mechanism using a CSV file.

**Vlearned Tip**: The CSV bulk import process is detailed at [https://storage.googleapis.com/welearned-bucket/bulk\_import\_instructions.pdf](https://storage.googleapis.com/welearned-bucket/bulk\_import\_instructions.pdf)
{% endhint %}

## Managing a user

After onboarding a user, clicking on their email takes you to the **Role Manager** and **Danger Zone** modules.

### Role Manager

The role manager is in equal parts useful and dangerous. You can change a user's role in this section but doing so will result in loss of access to their previous role and all actions taken in it. The role manager displays the current role of the user and gives you options for the new role you would like to assign.

### Danger Zone

This section enables you to delete users from the system.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Be careful of any actions taken here as they might be not only be detrimental but irreversible.
{% endhint %}
